# Just another [Battery](https://github.com/Goles/Battery) for [nerds](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

### Features

* Displays battery percentage
* **Battery percent is displayed in emojis (thanks to [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts))**
* If you don't like the default colors, you can specify the good, medium and warning battery status colors using flags (read usage).
